    "\n",
    "    # 1. Change in Performance Metric: A standard approach is to monitor a specific performance metric, like validation\n",

    "    # 2. Generalization vs. Training Time: Research suggests that \"slower\" stopping criteria, which allow more epochs\n",

    "    # criteria. However, this comes at the cost of longer training times and increased computational resources.\n",

    "    # important about your model. You might want to choose a performance metric that best defines the model's utility\n",
    "    # for its intended application. For example, in a classification task, you might prioritize accuracy or F1 score\n",
    "    # over loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 4. Learning Curves Analysis: Before implementing early stopping, it's helpful to train your model for a\n",
