# Purpose
A baseline repo to practice a series of increasingly difficult tensorflow exercises.

# Tensorflow
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source library developed by Google for numerical computation and 
machine learning. It's particularly known for its use in deep learning, a subset of machine learning where neural 
networks—models inspired by the human brain—learn from large amounts of data. TensorFlow allows developers to create 
complex machine learning models with ease, thanks to its powerful computational capabilities and flexible architecture. 
It supports various languages, but is most commonly used with Python. Its versatility allows it to be used in many 
fields, from voice/sound recognition to medical diagnosis, and even in mobile applications. TensorFlow is suitable for 
both beginners and advanced users, offering a balance between simplicity for basic tasks and flexibility for more 
complex ones.

# Supported GPUs
TensorFlow's GPU support encompasses a range of hardware and associated software platforms:

* NVIDIA: Supported via Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) toolkit, offering optimized performance especially on
* models that leverage deep learning and large datasets.

* Intel: TensorFlow can run on Intel CPUs, but GPU support for TensorFlow via Intel's oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library
* (oneDNN) is more limited compared to NVIDIA's offerings.

* AMD: APUs and GPUs can be used with TensorFlow through Radeon Open Compute (ROCm), an open-source platform for 
* GPU-accelerated computing. However, compatibility and performance might not be as extensive as with NVIDIA's CUDA.

* Mac GPUs: With TensorFlow 2.4 and later, Apple's Metal Performance Shaders are leveraged for GPU acceleration on Macs 
* with M1 and above. This provides a significant performance boost compared to running TensorFlow solely on the CPU.

It's important to verify the specific compatibility and supported features for TensorFlow with the respective hardware 
vendors, as the support can vary significantly based on the GPU architecture and the software stack.**
